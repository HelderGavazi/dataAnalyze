Project: Trading Robots developed in MQL5 (This stage is a follow up from my previous An Expert Advisor MQL4 project)

Introduction:

An Expert Advisor is the 'pinnacle' of programming and the desired goal of every automated trading developer, the aime of this project is to write a simple Expert Advisors in the MQL5 language. We will begin first by defining what we want our EA (Expert advisor) to do, and then move on to how we want the EA to do it.

"Before starting to code, there are certain habits that we need to add to our coding that can help us stay focused all the coding time. Most of the time we might find ourselves coding but not realizing that we are not being effective due to various reasons, such as lack of focus, having no plan or having poor plan of execution."

Planning your project before coding
Make code snippets collection
Have a routine
Schedule deep works
Make small single purpose functions and test them
Add comments to your future self
Touch typing habit
Using the best tools
Do version control
